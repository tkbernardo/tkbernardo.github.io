											<h2>Summary</h2>
											<p>Stretto, a bankruptcy management services company, had just acquired CINgroup, a competitor in the industry. CINgroup had been contracting out the printing and mailing of all its client's legal notices to to a third party vendor. Since Stretto had just invested in its own printing facility it was decided that this business should be brought in-house. I was tasked with designing a system that would integrate with CINgroup’s existing systems, and allow Stretto's print and mail facility to receive, manage and execute on those orders.</p>

							<h2>Problem Space</h2>
							<p>The type of business Stretto was attempting to capature is high volume, low margin. This meant that automation was needed in order to maintain a profit margin. In addtion, it was decided that the contract with the third party would not be renewed. This only left several months to define an MVP, design the system, and document the requirements for development.</p>

							<h3>Main constraints we had to consider:</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Re-routing orders from third party system to new internal system and data field standardization.</li>
								<li>Supporting user profiles and permissions.</li>
								<li>Supporting order submission, order status for internal and external users, routing of orders to multiple facilities, and reporting.</li>
								<li>Must integrate with upstream systems (order submission &amp; payment lookup) and downstream systems (billing &amp; invoicing).</li>
								<li>Allowing for future integrations of other business lines.</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>Process</h2>
							
							<h3>Plan</h3>
							<p>Due to the tight timeline it was decided that we would leverage CINgroup's existing system because they already had an infrustructre for user profiles and permissions, account lookup, and payment processing. This allowed me to focus on the user flow, and not have to design a new interface.</p>
							
							<h3>Research</h3>
							<p>I started out by creating a Research Protocol which commuincated to the Business the problem we're trying to solve for, the methods I would be conducting, how long the process will take, and the expected delierables. I conducted user interviews with the team, observed their work process, and analyzed their systems, tools and deliverables.</p>

							<h3>Design</h3>
							<p>From the data collected I was able to put together a complete picture of what they needed to carry out their work, and translate that into functional prototype. This prototype was useful for collecting feedback from the stakeholder as well as the development team.</p>

							<h3>Testing</h3>
							<p>Before the release of the system to End Users I conducted Usability Study with five Production Team members. From this study I documented and prioritized bugs and usability issues to be fixed.</p>

							<h2>Methods</h2>
							<div class="items style1 medium align-center onscroll-fade-in">
								<section>
									<span class="icon style2 major fa-comments-o"></span>
									<h3>Interviews</h3>
									<p>I interviewed five team members accross two facilities to understand their needs, goals and pain points.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon style2 major fa-search"></span>
									<h3>Contextual Inquiry</h3>
									<p>I observed team members and asked questions about their process in the printing facility.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon style2 major fa-sitemap"></span>
									<h3>Affinity Diagramming</h3>
									<p>I ran a group Affinity Diagramming workshop with the Product Team to process the interview data.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon style2 major  fa-map-o"></span>
									<h3>Journey Mapping</h3>
									<p>I created a journey map to communicate the print production process to the Product Team and Developers.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon style2 major fa-object-group"></span>
									<h3>Prototyping</h3>
									<p>I created an Axure prototype, and high level User Stories, to document requirements and for user testing.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon style2 major fa-user"></span>
									<h3>User Testing</h3>
									<p>I ran a Usability Study with End Users, before release, to uncover any bugs or usability issues.</p>

							<blockquote>
								<p>"Tristan is a very thorough and focused UI/UX designer. I worked with him on a project where he was responsible for documenting and wire framing our company’s document production user experience in preparation of a significant software build. As a stakeholder of the project I was impressed with how quickly Tristan ramped up. He asked thoughtful and insightful questions that showed a true understanding of the process and set us up for success. His on-time UI/UX design deliverable was exactly what the business needed and had tasked him with. Tristan is very professional and is a valued team member."</p>
